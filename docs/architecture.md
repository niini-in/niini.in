# MiniShop Architecture

## Overview

MiniShop is designed as a cloud-native, microservices-based e-commerce platform that follows modern architectural patterns and best practices. This document outlines the high-level architecture, component interactions, and design decisions.

## Architectural Principles

- **Microservices-based**: Each service has a single responsibility and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently
- **API-first**: All services expose well-defined APIs for communication
- **Cloud-native**: Designed to run optimally in containerized environments like Kubernetes
- **Event-driven**: Leverages event sourcing and CQRS patterns where appropriate
- **Infrastructure as Code**: All infrastructure defined and managed through code
- **GitOps**: Declarative infrastructure and application configuration stored in Git
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and tracing built-in from the start

## System Components

### Frontend Applications

- **Customer Web App**: React-based SPA for customers
- **Admin Dashboard**: React-based SPA for administrators
- **Mobile Apps**: Native mobile applications (future)

### API Gateway

Spring Cloud Gateway serves as the entry point for all client requests, providing:

- Request routing
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting
- Request/response transformation
- API documentation aggregation

### Microservices

#### User Service (Java/Spring Boot)

Responsible for user management, authentication, and authorization:

- User registration and profile management
- Authentication (OAuth2/OIDC)
- Role-based access control
- User preferences

#### Product Service (Go)

Manages the product catalog and inventory:

- Product information management
- Category management
- Inventory tracking
- Product search and filtering

#### Order Service (Java/Spring Boot)

Handles order processing and management:

- Order creation and management
- Order status tracking
- Order history
- Returns and refunds processing

#### Payment Service (Python/FastAPI)

Processes payments and integrates with payment gateways:

- Payment processing
- Payment gateway integration
- Transaction history
- Refund processing

#### Notification Service (Node.js)

Manages communication with users:

- Email notifications
- SMS notifications
- Push notifications
- Notification preferences

### Data Storage

- **PostgreSQL**: Primary relational database for user, order, and product services
- **MongoDB**: Document store for flexible data models
- **Redis**: Caching and session management
- **Elasticsearch**: Product search and analytics

### Message Broker

Apache Kafka serves as the backbone for asynchronous communication between services:

- Event sourcing
- Command and event distribution
- Stream processing

### Observability Stack

- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and alerting
- **Grafana**: Metrics visualization
- **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing
- **ELK Stack**: Centralized logging

## Communication Patterns

### Synchronous Communication

- REST APIs for direct service-to-service communication
- gRPC for high-performance internal communication

### Asynchronous Communication

- Event-driven architecture using Kafka
- Publish-subscribe pattern for event distribution
- CQRS pattern for complex domains

## Deployment Architecture

### Kubernetes Resources

- **Deployments**: For stateless services
- **StatefulSets**: For stateful services
- **Services**: For service discovery
- **Ingress**: For external access
- **ConfigMaps/Secrets**: For configuration

### Multi-Environment Setup

- Development
- Staging
- Production

Each environment is isolated with its own namespace and resources.

### GitOps Workflow

- Git repositories as the source of truth
- ArgoCD for continuous deployment
- Helm charts for Kubernetes resource templating

## Security Architecture

- **Authentication**: OAuth2/OIDC with JWT
- **Authorization**: RBAC at API Gateway and service level
- **TLS**: End-to-end encryption with cert-manager
- **Secrets Management**: Kubernetes Secrets or HashiCorp Vault
- **Network Policies**: Service-to-service communication restrictions

## Scalability Considerations

- Horizontal scaling of stateless services
- Database sharding for high-volume data
- Caching strategies for read-heavy workloads
- Asynchronous processing for long-running tasks

## Disaster Recovery

- Regular database backups
- Multi-region deployment capability
- Automated failover mechanisms
- Chaos engineering practices

## Future Enhancements

- Service mesh implementation (Istio/Linkerd)
- Advanced canary deployments
- AI-powered recommendations
- Real-time analytics
